Make sure that you are using only packages that are whitelisted [here](https://adialab.crunchdao.io/submit?tab=libraries).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`train()`**: In the training phase the users will build the model and train it such that it can perform inferences on the testing data. The model must be saved in the `resources` directory.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`infer()`**: In the inference function the model trained in the previous step will be loaded and used to perform inferences on a data sample matching the characteristic of the training test.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Scoring on the public leaderboard\n",
        "\n",
        "To ensure the reliability of the public leaderboard, you don't have access to all of the testing data on which you will be scored.\n",
        "The `X_test` data downloaded in your workspace is composed of **only** 5 dates to test locally that your code actually runs when submitted. Notice that `y_test` is not available for those 5 dates.\n",
        "Once you have uploaded your solution the system will run your code on a larger test set of approximately 30 dates, and compute the score.\n",
        "\n",
        "When submitting, you are left to decide how frequently to retrain your model, considering the limit of 5 hours of resources / week / user allowed to predict the 30 dates of the private test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Scoring on the out-of-sample phase\n",
        "\n",
        "During the out-of-sample phase, after the submission period ends, the system will call your code 3 times every week on live datapoint.\n",
